""" Generic Unification algorithm for expression trees with lists of children

This implementation is a direct translation of

Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach by Stuart Russel and Peter Norvig
Second edition, section 9.2, page 276

It is modified in the following ways:

1.  We allow associative and commutative Compound expressions. This results in
    combinatorial blowup.
2.  We explore the tree lazily.
3.  We provide generic interfaces to symbolic algebra libraries in Python.
