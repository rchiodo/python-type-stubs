"""Tools for optimizing a linear function for a given simplex.

For the linear objective function ``f`` with linear constraints
expressed using `Le`, `Ge` or `Eq` can be found with ``lpmin`` or
``lpmax``. The symbols are **unbounded** unless specifically
constrained.

As an alternative, the matrices describing the objective and the
constraints, and an optional list of bounds can be passed to
``linprog`` which will solve for the minimization of ``C*x``
under constraints ``A*x <= b`` and/or ``Aeq*x = beq``, and
individual bounds for variables given as ``(lo, hi)``. The values
returned are **nonnegative** unless bounds are provided that
indicate otherwise.

Errors that might be raised are UnboundedLPError when there is no
finite solution for the system or InfeasibleLPError when the
constraints represent impossible conditions (i.e. a non-existant
 simplex).

Here is a simple 1-D system: minimize `x` given that ``x >= 1``.

    >>> from sympy.solvers.simplex import lpmin, linprog
    >>> from sympy.abc import x

    The function and a list with the constraint is passed directly
    to `lpmin`:

    >>> lpmin(x, [x >= 1])
    (1, {x: 1})

    For `linprog` the matrix for the objective is `[1]` and the
    uivariate constraint can be passed as a bound with None acting
    as infinity:

    >>> linprog([1], bounds=(1, None))
    (1, [1])

    Or the matrices, corresponding to ``x >= 1`` expressed as
    ``-x <= -1`` as required by the routine, can be passed:

    >>> linprog([1], [-1], [-1])
    (1, [1])

    If there is no limit for the objective, an error is raised.
    In this case there is a valid region of interest (simplex)
    but no limit to how small ``x`` can be:

    >>> lpmin(x, [])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    sympy.solvers.simplex.UnboundedLPError:
    Objective function can assume arbitrarily large values!

    An error is raised if there is no possible solution:

    >>> lpmin(x,[x<=1,x>=2])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    sympy.solvers.simplex.InfeasibleLPError:
    Inconsistent/False constraint

    """Return the minimization of ``c*x`` with the given

    are given, variables will have nonnegative values in the solution.

    If ``A`` is not given, then the dimension of the system will
    be determined by the length of ``C``.

    By default, all variables will be nonnegative. If ``bounds``
    is given as a single tuple, ``(lo, hi)``, then all variables
    will be constrained to be between ``lo`` and ``hi``. Use
    None for a ``lo`` or ``hi`` if it is unconstrained in the
    negative or positive direction, respectively, e.g.
    ``(None, 0)`` indicates nonpositive values. To set
    individual ranges, pass a list with length equal to the
    number of columns in ``A``, each element being a tuple; if
    only a few variables take on non-default values they can be
    passed as a dictionary with keys giving the corresponding
