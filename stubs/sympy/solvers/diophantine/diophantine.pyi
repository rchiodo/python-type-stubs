    Simplify the solution procedure of diophantine equation ``eq`` by
    converting it into a product of terms which should equal zero.

    Explanation
    ===========

    For example, when solving, `x^2 - y^2 = 0` this is treated as
    `(x + y)(x - y) = 0` and `x + y = 0` and `x - y = 0` are solved
    independently and combined. Each term is solved by calling
    ``diop_solve()``. (Although it is possible to call ``diop_solve()``
    directly, one must be careful to pass an equation in the correct
    form and to interpret the output correctly; ``diophantine()`` is
    the public-facing function to use in general.)

    Output of ``diophantine()`` is a set of tuples. The elements of the
    tuple are the solutions for each variable in the equation and
    are arranged according to the alphabetic ordering of the variables.
    e.g. For an equation with two variables, `a` and `b`, the first
    element of the tuple is the solution for `a` and the second for `b`.

    Usage
    =====

    ``diophantine(eq, t, syms)``: Solve the diophantine
    equation ``eq``.
    ``t`` is the optional parameter to be used by ``diop_solve()``.
    ``syms`` is an optional list of symbols which determines the
    order of the elements in the returned tuple.

    By default, only the base solution is returned. If ``permute`` is set to
    True then permutations of the base solution and/or permutations of the
    signs of the values will be returned when applicable.

    Details
    =======

    ``eq`` should be an expression which is assumed to be zero.
    ``t`` is the parameter to be used in the solution.

    Examples
    ========

    integer constants and `x` is an integer variable.

    This is used to solve the general quadratic equation by transforming it to

    [-4/13]])

    A, B  returned are such that Transpose((x y)) =  A * Transpose((X Y)) + B.
    Substituting these values for `x` and `y` and a bit of simplifying work
    will give an equation of the form `x^2 - Dy^2 = N`.

    >>> from sympy.abc import X, Y
    >>> from sympy import Matrix, simplify
    >>> u = (A*Matrix([X, Y]) + B)[0] # Transformation for x

    >>> v = (A*Matrix([X, Y]) + B)[1] # Transformation for y
    >>> v
    Y/13 - 4/13

    Next we will substitute these formulas for `x` and `y` and do
    ``simplify()``.

    >>> eq
    X**2/676 - Y**2/52 + 17/13

    By multiplying the denominator appropriately, we can get a Pell equation

def gaussian_reduce(w: int, a: int, b: int) -> tuple[int, int]:
    r"""
    Returns a reduced solution `(x, z)` to the congruence
    `X^2 - aZ^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{b}` so that `x^2 + |a|z^2` is as small as possible.
    Here ``w`` is a solution of the congruence `x^2 \equiv a \pmod{b}`.

    This function is intended to be used only for ``descent()``.

    Explanation
    ===========

    The Gaussian reduction can find the shortest vector for any norm.
    So we define the special norm for the vectors `u = (u_1, u_2)` and `v = (v_1, v_2)` as follows.

    .. math ::
        u \cdot v := (wu_1 + bu_2)(wv_1 + bv_2) + |a|u_1v_1

    Note that, given the mapping `f: (u_1, u_2) \to (wu_1 + bu_2, u_1)`,
    `f((u_1,u_2))` is the solution to `X^2 - aZ^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{b}`.
    In other words, finding the shortest vector in this norm will yield a solution with smaller `X^2 + |a|Z^2`.
    The algorithm starts from basis vectors `(0, 1)` and `(1, 0)`
    (corresponding to solutions `(b, 0)` and `(w, 1)`, respectively) and finds the shortest vector.
    The shortest vector does not necessarily correspond to the smallest solution,
    but since ``descent()`` only wants the smallest possible solution, it is sufficient.

    Parameters
    ==========

    w : int
        ``w`` s.t. `w^2 \equiv a \pmod{b}`
    a : int
        square-free nonzero integer
    b : int
        square-free nonzero integer

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.solvers.diophantine.diophantine import gaussian_reduce
    >>> from sympy.ntheory.residue_ntheory import sqrt_mod
    >>> a, b = 19, 101
    >>> gaussian_reduce(sqrt_mod(a, b), a, b) # 1**2 - 19*(-4)**2 = -303
    (1, -4)
    >>> a, b = 11, 14
    >>> x, z = gaussian_reduce(sqrt_mod(a, b), a, b)
    >>> (x**2 - a*z**2) % b == 0
    True

    It does not always return the smallest solution.

    >>> a, b = 6, 95
    >>> min_x, min_z = 1, 4
    >>> x, z = gaussian_reduce(sqrt_mod(a, b), a, b)
    >>> (x**2 - a*z**2) % b == 0 and (min_x**2 - a*min_z**2) % b == 0
    True

    ===========

    A partition of `n` is a set of positive integers which add up to `n`. For

    ``k``.

    ``zero`` parameter is considered only if ``k`` is not None. When the

    exception, so this function should always be used inside a try - except
