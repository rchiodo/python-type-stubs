        If ``g(x) = (a*x + b)**2 - N``. `g(x)` can be expanded
        to ``a*x**2 + 2*a*b*x + b**2 - N``, so the coefficient
        is stored in the form `[a**2, 2*a*b, b**2 - N]`. This
        ensures faster `eval` method because we dont have to
        perform `a**2, 2*a*b, b**2` every time we call the
        `eval` method. As multiplication is more expensive
        than addition, by using modified_coefficient we get
        a faster seiving process.

def qs(N, prime_bound, M, ERROR_TERM=..., seed=...) -> set[Any]:
    """Performs factorization using Self-Initializing Quadratic Sieve.
    In SIQS, let N be a number to be factored, and this N should not be a
    perfect power. If we find two integers such that ``X**2 = Y**2 modN`` and
    ``X != +-Y modN``, then `gcd(X + Y, N)` will reveal a proper factor of N.
    In order to find these integers X and Y we try to find relations of form
    t**2 = u modN where u is a product of small primes. If we have enough of
    these relations then we can form ``(t1*t2...ti)**2 = u1*u2...ui modN`` such that
    the right hand side is a square, thus we found a relation of ``X**2 = Y**2 modN``.

    Here, several optimizations are done like using multiple polynomials for
    sieving, fast changing between polynomials and using partial relations.
    The use of partial relations can speeds up the factoring by 2 times.

    Parameters
    ==========

    N : Number to be Factored
    prime_bound : upper bound for primes in the factor base
    M : Sieve Interval
    ERROR_TERM : Error term for checking smoothness
    threshold : Extra smooth relations for factorization
    seed : generate pseudo prime numbers

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.ntheory import qs
    >>> qs(25645121643901801, 2000, 10000)
