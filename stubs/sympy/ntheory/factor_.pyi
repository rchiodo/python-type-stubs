    perfect power with ``e > 1``, else ``False`` (e.g. 1 is not a

    By default, the base is recursively decomposed and the exponents
    collected so the largest possible ``e`` is sought. If ``big=False``
    then the smallest possible ``e`` (thus prime) will be chosen.

    If ``factor=True`` then simultaneous factorization of ``n`` is
    attempted since finding a factor indicates the only possible root
    for ``n``. This is True by default since only a few small factors will
    be tested in the course of searching for the perfect power.

    The use of ``candidates`` is primarily for internal use; if provided,
    False will be returned if ``n`` cannot be written as a power with one
    of the candidates as an exponent and factoring (beyond testing for
    a factor of 2) will not be attempted.

def pollard_rho(n, s=..., a=..., retries=..., seed=..., max_steps=..., F=...) -> int | None:
    r"""
    Use Pollard's rho method to try to extract a nontrivial factor
    of ``n``. The returned factor may be a composite number. If no
    factor is found, ``None`` is returned.

    The algorithm generates pseudo-random values of x with a generator
    function, replacing x with F(x). If F is not supplied then the
    function x**2 + ``a`` is used. The first value supplied to F(x) is ``s``.
    Upon failure (if ``retries`` is > 0) a new ``a`` and ``s`` will be
    supplied; the ``a`` will be ignored if F was supplied.

    The sequence of numbers generated by such functions generally have a
    a lead-up to some number and then loop around back to that number and
    begin to repeat the sequence, e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5 -- this leader
    and loop look a bit like the Greek letter rho, and thus the name, 'rho'.

    For a given function, very different leader-loop values can be obtained
    so it is a good idea to allow for retries:

    >>> from sympy.ntheory.generate import cycle_length
    >>> n = 16843009
    >>> F = lambda x:(2048*pow(x, 2, n) + 32767) % n
    >>> for s in range(5):
    ...     print('loop length = %4i; leader length = %3i' % next(cycle_length(F, s)))
    ...
    loop length = 2489; leader length =  43
    loop length =   78; leader length = 121
    loop length = 1482; leader length = 100
    loop length = 1482; leader length = 286
    loop length = 1482; leader length = 101

    Here is an explicit example where there is a three element leadup to
    a sequence of 3 numbers (11, 14, 4) that then repeat:

    >>> x=2
    >>> for i in range(9):
    ...     print(x)
    ...     x=(x**2+12)%17
    ...
    2
    16
    13
    11
    14
    4
    11
    14
    4
    >>> next(cycle_length(lambda x: (x**2+12)%17, 2))
    (3, 3)
    >>> list(cycle_length(lambda x: (x**2+12)%17, 2, values=True))
    [2, 16, 13, 11, 14, 4]

    Instead of checking the differences of all generated values for a gcd
    with n, only the kth and 2*kth numbers are checked, e.g. 1st and 2nd,
    2nd and 4th, 3rd and 6th until it has been detected that the loop has been
    traversed. Loops may be many thousands of steps long before rho finds a
    factor or reports failure. If ``max_steps`` is specified, the iteration
    is cancelled with a failure after the specified number of steps.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import pollard_rho
    >>> n=16843009
    >>> F=lambda x:(2048*pow(x,2,n) + 32767) % n
    >>> pollard_rho(n, F=F)
    257

    Use the default setting with a bad value of ``a`` and no retries:

    >>> pollard_rho(n, a=n-2, retries=0)

    If retries is > 0 then perhaps the problem will correct itself when
    new values are generated for a:

    >>> pollard_rho(n, a=n-2, retries=1)
    257

def pollard_pm1(n, B=..., a=..., retries=..., seed=...) -> int | None:
    """
    Use Pollard's p-1 method to try to extract a nontrivial factor
    of ``n``. Either a divisor (perhaps composite) or ``None`` is returned.

    The value of ``a`` is the base that is used in the test gcd(a**M - 1, n).
    The default is 2.  If ``retries`` > 0 then if no factor is found after the
    first attempt, a new ``a`` will be generated randomly (using the ``seed``)
    and the process repeated.

    Note: the value of M is lcm(1..B) = reduce(ilcm, range(2, B + 1)).

    A search is made for factors next to even numbers having a power smoothness
    less than ``B``. Choosing a larger B increases the likelihood of finding a
    larger factor but takes longer. Whether a factor of n is found or not
    depends on ``a`` and the power smoothness of the even number just less than
    the factor p (hence the name p - 1).

    Although some discussion of what constitutes a good ``a`` some
    descriptions are hard to interpret. At the modular.math site referenced
    below it is stated that if gcd(a**M - 1, n) = N then a**M % q**r is 1
    for every prime power divisor of N. But consider the following:

        >>> from sympy.ntheory.factor_ import smoothness_p, pollard_pm1
        >>> n=257*1009
        >>> smoothness_p(n)
        (-1, [(257, (1, 2, 256)), (1009, (1, 7, 16))])

    So we should (and can) find a root with B=16:

        >>> pollard_pm1(n, B=16, a=3)
        1009

    If we attempt to increase B to 256 we find that it does not work:

        >>> pollard_pm1(n, B=256)
        >>>

    But if the value of ``a`` is changed we find that only multiples of
    257 work, e.g.:

        >>> pollard_pm1(n, B=256, a=257)
        1009

    Checking different ``a`` values shows that all the ones that did not
    work had a gcd value not equal to ``n`` but equal to one of the
    factors:

        >>> from sympy import ilcm, igcd, factorint, Pow
        >>> M = 1
        >>> for i in range(2, 256):
        ...     M = ilcm(M, i)
        ...
        >>> set([igcd(pow(a, M, n) - 1, n) for a in range(2, 256) if
        ...      igcd(pow(a, M, n) - 1, n) != n])
        {1009}

    But does aM % d for every divisor of n give 1?

        >>> aM = pow(255, M, n)
        >>> [(d, aM%Pow(*d.args)) for d in factorint(n, visual=True).args]
        [(257**1, 1), (1009**1, 1)]

    No, only one of them. So perhaps the principle is that a root will
    be found for a given value of B provided that:

    1) the power smoothness of the p - 1 value next to the root
       does not exceed B
    2) a**M % p != 1 for any of the divisors of n.

    By trying more than one ``a`` it is possible that one of them
    will yield a factor.

    Examples
    ========

    With the default smoothness bound, this number cannot be cracked:

        >>> from sympy.ntheory import pollard_pm1
        >>> pollard_pm1(21477639576571)

    Increasing the smoothness bound helps:

        >>> pollard_pm1(21477639576571, B=2000)
        4410317

    Looking at the smoothness of the factors of this number we find:

        >>> from sympy.ntheory.factor_ import smoothness_p, factorint
        >>> print(smoothness_p(21477639576571, visual=1))
        p**i=4410317**1 has p-1 B=1787, B-pow=1787
        p**i=4869863**1 has p-1 B=2434931, B-pow=2434931

    The B and B-pow are the same for the p - 1 factorizations of the divisors
    because those factorizations had a very large prime factor:

        >>> factorint(4410317 - 1)
        {2: 2, 617: 1, 1787: 1}
        >>> factorint(4869863-1)
        {2: 1, 2434931: 1}

    Note that until B reaches the B-pow value of 1787, the number is not cracked;

        >>> pollard_pm1(21477639576571, B=1786)
        >>> pollard_pm1(21477639576571, B=1787)
        4410317

    The B value has to do with the factors of the number next to the divisor,
    not the divisors themselves. A worst case scenario is that the number next
    to the factor p has a large prime divisisor or is a perfect power. If these
    conditions apply then the power-smoothness will be about p/2 or p. The more
    realistic is that there will be a large prime factor next to p requiring
    a B value on the order of p/2. Although primes may have been searched for
    up to this level, the p/2 is a factor of p - 1, something that we do not
    know. The modular.math reference below states that 15% of numbers in the
    range of 10**15 to 15**15 + 10**4 are 10**6 power smooth so a B of 10**6
    will fail 85% of the time in that range. From 10**8 to 10**8 + 10**3 the
    percentages are nearly reversed...but in that range the simple trial
    division is quite fast.

    Given a positive integer ``n``, ``factorint(n)`` returns a dict containing
    the prime factors of ``n`` as keys and their respective multiplicities
    as values. For example:

    >>> from sympy.ntheory import factorint
    >>> factorint(2000)    # 2000 = (2**4) * (5**3)
    {2: 4, 5: 3}
    >>> factorint(65537)   # This number is prime
    {65537: 1}

    For input less than 2, factorint behaves as follows:

        - ``factorint(1)`` returns the empty factorization, ``{}``
        - ``factorint(0)`` returns ``{0:1}``
        - ``factorint(-n)`` adds ``-1:1`` to the factors and then factors ``n``

    Partial Factorization:

    If ``limit`` (> 3) is specified, the search is stopped after performing
    trial division up to (and including) the limit (or taking a
    corresponding number of rho/p-1 steps). This is useful if one has
    a large number and only is interested in finding small factors (if
    any). Note that setting a limit does not prevent larger factors
    from being found early; it simply means that the largest factor may
    be composite. Since checking for perfect power is relatively cheap, it is
    done regardless of the limit setting.

    This number, for example, has two small factors and a huge
    semi-prime factor that cannot be reduced easily:

    >>> from sympy.ntheory import isprime
    >>> a = 1407633717262338957430697921446883
    >>> f = factorint(a, limit=10000)
    >>> f == {991: 1, int(202916782076162456022877024859): 1, 7: 1}
    True
    >>> isprime(max(f))
    False

    This number has a small factor and a residual perfect power whose
    base is greater than the limit:

    >>> factorint(3*101**7, limit=5)
    {3: 1, 101: 7}

    List of Factors:

    If ``multiple`` is set to ``True`` then a list containing the
    prime factors including multiplicities is returned.

    >>> factorint(24, multiple=True)
    [2, 2, 2, 3]

    Visual Factorization:

    If ``visual`` is set to ``True``, then it will return a visual
    factorization of the integer.  For example:

    >>> from sympy import pprint
    >>> pprint(factorint(4200, visual=True))
     3  1  2  1
    2 *3 *5 *7

    Note that this is achieved by using the evaluate=False flag in Mul
    and Pow. If you do other manipulations with an expression where
    evaluate=False, it may evaluate.  Therefore, you should use the
    visual option only for visualization, and use the normal dictionary
    returned by visual=False if you want to perform operations on the
    factors.

    You can easily switch between the two forms by sending them back to
    factorint:

    >>> from sympy import Mul
    >>> regular = factorint(1764); regular
    {2: 2, 3: 2, 7: 2}
    >>> pprint(factorint(regular))
     2  2  2
    2 *3 *7

    >>> visual = factorint(1764, visual=True); pprint(visual)
     2  2  2
    2 *3 *7
    >>> print(factorint(visual))
    {2: 2, 3: 2, 7: 2}

    If you want to send a number to be factored in a partially factored form
    you can do so with a dictionary or unevaluated expression:

    >>> factorint(factorint({4: 2, 12: 3})) # twice to toggle to dict form
    {2: 10, 3: 3}
    >>> factorint(Mul(4, 12, evaluate=False))

    Algorithm:

    The function switches between multiple algorithms. Trial division
    quickly finds small factors (of the order 1-5 digits), and finds
    all large factors if given enough time. The Pollard rho and p-1
    algorithms are used to find large factors ahead of time; they
    will often find factors of the order of 10 digits within a few
    seconds:

    >>> factors = factorint(12345678910111213141516)
