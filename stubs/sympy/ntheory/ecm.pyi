class Point:
    """Montgomery form of Points in an elliptic curve.
    In this form, the addition and doubling of points
    does not need any y-coordinate information thus
    decreasing the number of operations.
    Using Montgomery form we try to perform point addition
    and doubling in least amount of multiplications.

    The elliptic curve used here is of the form
    (E : b*y**2*z = x**3 + a*x**2*z + x*z**2).
    The a_24 parameter is equal to (a + 2)/4.

    def add(self, Q, diff) -> Point:

        Add two points self and Q where diff = self - Q. Moreover the assumption
        is self.x_cord*Q.x_cord*(self.x_cord - Q.x_cord) != 0. This algorithm
        requires 6 multiplications. Here the difference between the points
        is already known and using this algorithm speeds up the addition
        by reducing the number of multiplication required. Also in the
        mont_ladder algorithm is constructed in a way so that the difference
        between intermediate points is always equal to the initial point.
        So, we always know what the difference between the point is.
