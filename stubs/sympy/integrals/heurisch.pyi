    A wrapper around the heurisch integration algorithm.

    Explanation
    ===========

    This method takes the result from heurisch and checks for poles in the
    denominator. For each of these poles, the integral is reevaluated, and
    the final integration result is given in terms of a Piecewise.

    Examples

    >>> from sympy import cos, symbols

    Explanation

    The standard form of the derivative of a Bessel function of order n
    contains two Bessel functions of orders n-1 and n+1, respectively.
    Such forms cannot be used in parallel Risch algorithm, because
    there is a linear recurrence relation between the three functions
    while the algorithm expects that functions and derivatives are
    represented in terms of algebraically independent transcendentals.

    The solution is to take two of the functions, e.g., those of orders
    n and n-1, and to express the derivatives in terms of the pair.
    To guarantee that the proper form is used the two derivatives are
    cached as soon as one is encountered.

    Derivatives of other functions are also cached at no extra cost.
    All derivatives are with respect to the same variable `x`.

    """
    Compute indefinite integral using heuristic Risch algorithm.

    Explanation
    ===========

    This is a heuristic approach to indefinite integration in finite
    terms using the extended heuristic (parallel) Risch algorithm, based
    on Manuel Bronstein's "Poor Man's Integrator".

    The algorithm supports various classes of functions including
    transcendental elementary or special functions like Airy,
    Bessel, Whittaker and Lambert.

    Note that this algorithm is not a decision procedure. If it isn't
    able to compute the antiderivative for a given function, then this is
    not a proof that such a functions does not exist.  One should use
    recursive Risch algorithm in such case.  It's an open question if
    this algorithm can be made a full decision procedure.

    This is an internal integrator procedure. You should use top level
    'integrate' function in most cases, as this procedure needs some
    preprocessing steps and otherwise may fail.

    Specification
    =============

     heurisch(f, x, rewrite=False, hints=None)

       where
         f : expression
         x : symbol

         rewrite -> force rewrite 'f' in terms of 'tan' and 'tanh'
         hints   -> a list of functions that may appear in anti-derivate

          - hints = None          --> no suggestions at all
          - hints = [ ]           --> try to figure out
          - hints = [f1, ..., fn] --> we know better

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import tan
    >>> from sympy.integrals.heurisch import heurisch
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y

    >>> heurisch(y*tan(x), x)
    y*log(tan(x)**2 + 1)/2
